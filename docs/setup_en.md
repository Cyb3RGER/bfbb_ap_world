## Create a Config (.yaml) File

### What is a config file and why do I need one?

See the guide on setting up a basic YAML at the Archipelago setup
guide: [Basic Multiworld Setup Guide](/tutorial/Archipelago/setup/en)

### Where do I get a config file?

ToDo
The Player Settings page on the website allows you to configure your personal settings and export a config file from
them. Player settings page: [Battle for Bikini Bottom Settings Page](/games/Battle%20for%20Bikini%20Bottom/player-settings)

### Verifying your config file

If you would like to validate your config file to make sure it works, you may do so on the YAML Validator page. YAML
validator page: [YAML Validation page](/mysterycheck)

## Joining a MultiWorld Game

Open the game, select a save file and start a new run. Open the Mod Config Menu (the default key binding is ``L``) and 
navigate to *AP Integration* and set the appropriate ip, port, slot name and optionally password for your Archipelago 
server and slot and hit reconnect.

## Hosting a MultiWorld game

The recommended way to host a game is to use our hosting service. The process is relatively simple:

1. Collect config files from your players.
2. Create a zip file containing your players' config files.
3. Upload that zip file to the Generate page above.
    - Generate page: [WebHost Seed Generation Page](/generate)
4. Wait a moment while the seed is generated.
5. When the seed is generated, you will be redirected to a "Seed Info" page.
6. Click "Create New Room". This will take you to the server page. Provide the link to this page to your players, so
   they may download their patch files from there.
7. Note that a link to a MultiWorld Tracker is at the top of the room page. The tracker shows the progress of all
   players in the game. Any observers may also be given the link to this page.
8. Once all players have joined, you may begin playing.
