# SpongeBob SquarePants: Battle for Bikini Bottom

## Where is the settings page?

The [player settings page for this game](../player-settings) contains all the options you need to configure and export a
config file.

## What does randomization do to this game?

Items which the player would normally acquire throughout the game have been moved around. Logic remains, so the game is
always able to be completed, but because of the item shuffle the player may need to access certain areas before they
would in the vanilla game.

## What items and locations get shuffled?

Golden Spatulas will always be shuffled. Optionally you can also shuffle lost socks, golden underwear, level items (see
below) and purple shiny objects. Level items include:

- the King Jellyfish Jelly from Jellyfish Fields,
- the Steering Wheels from Downtown Bikini Bottom,
- the Balloon Kids from Goo Lagoon,
- the Museum Art from Rock Bottom,
- the Security Override Buttons from Mermalair,
- the Sandmans from Sand Mountain,
- the Lost Campers from Kelp Forest,
- the Power Crystals from Kelp Forest,
- the Ship Cannons from Flying Dutchman's Graveyard


## What is the goal of SpongeBob SquarePants: Battle for Bikini Bottom?

Same as vanilla, beat Robo-Spongebob.
